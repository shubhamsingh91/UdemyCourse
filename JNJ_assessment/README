## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- CMake (version 2.6 or higher)
- C++ Compiler (supporting C++11 standard)
- [Optional] Google Test (if building the tests)

### Build Instructions

Follow these steps to build the project:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

#### Building the Main Project

To build the main project, run the following commands:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will create an executable named main in the build directory.

####  Building the Tests (Optional)
To build the tests, ensure you have the Google Test framework installed.

Download and install Google Test by following the instructions provided in their documentation: [https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md].

Once Google Test is installed, enable the build of the tests by running the following commands:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make
```
This will create an executable named runTests in the build directory.

#### Running the Project
To run the main project, navigate to the build directory and execute the main executable:

```shell
cd build
./main
```
To run the tests (if built), navigate to the build directory and execute the runTests executable:

```shell
cd build
./runTests
```
